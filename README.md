# README.md

This repo has been created for the purpose of testing GCP Dialogflow CX conversational AI chatbot agents using Jupyter Notebook and [DFCX-Scrapi](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/dfcx-scrapi)...

The Dialogfow CX GUI is killing me, and using Terraform to build agent configurations is too riddled with bugs, errors, and poor documentation; granted it has helped with understanding the software artifacts and their relationships as system components.

The OG repo for building my first chatbot [bc-recorgds-ai-chatbot](https://github.com/iTrauco/bc-records-ai-chatbot) can be viewed here,but it seems much easierr to quickly slice and dice json agent config files with tooling I already love, e.g. Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy, gspread, etc.
